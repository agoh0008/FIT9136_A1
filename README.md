# FIT9136: Assignment 1 - Developing a Card Game

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 1 of the FIT9136 unit (Algorithms and programming foundations in Python).

This project involves designing and implementing a card game where a player can compete against a computer.

## Description of the Program

This Python script allows a user (player) to play a card game against a computer (robot). The game includes several functions to manage the game menu, create and shuffle the deck, pick cards, show the player's cards, and check the game result based on predefined rules.

## Game Features

### Game Menu
The `game_menu` function displays the game menu options for the player to start the game, shuffle the deck, pick a card, show their cards, check win or lose status, or exit the game.

### Create Deck
The `create_deck` function generates a deck of cards based on the selected suit and value combinations.

### Shuffle Deck
The `shuffle_deck` function shuffles the deck randomly while ensuring that specific cards are in predetermined positions.

### Pick Card
The `pick_card` function allows the player to pick a card randomly from the deck.

### Show Cards
The `show_cards` function displays the player's current cards.

### Check Result
The `check_result` function determines the game's winner based on a set of rules, comparing the player's and the computer's cards.

### Play Game
The `play_game` function puts together the overall structure of the card game.
